# Calculator
It is a Simple Calculator, consisting of multiplication, addition, subtraction, division and more.

# ❌ Errors
I tried to make it a scientific calculator but it didn't work out well so there will be some errors using the scientific feature

# ⭐ What's Special?
The only thing that I found special about this Calculator is that its made out of only 50-70 lines of code using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and still looks good.
